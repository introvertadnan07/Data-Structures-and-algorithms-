🚀 Day 1 — The Beginning

Today I start my journey into Data Structures and Algorithms.
No shortcuts, no rush — just consistent effort every single day.

This is the foundation every great programmer builds on.
I’m not competing with anyone else, only with the version of me that didn’t start yesterday.

Let’s write code, make mistakes, learn, and keep moving forward.
One problem at a time. One step closer every day.

# Data Structures & Algorithms Practice  
## 100 Days DSA – Day-2: Triangle & Pattern Problems

### 📁 Folder: `Day-2`  
This folder contains all the problem-solutions I completed on **Day 2** of my 100-Days DSA challenge.  
The files include various pattern problems and triangles, implemented in C++.

### 🗂️ Contents  
| Filename                   | Description                                   |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `Square.cpp`               | Print a square pattern of stars.              |
| `charSquare.cpp`           | Print a square pattern using characters.      |
| `code.cpp`                 | Miscellaneous code snippet for Day 2.         |
| `numSquare.cpp`            | Print a numeric square pattern.               |
| `star.cpp`                 | Print a star-pattern problem.                  |
| `output/`                  | Executable binaries/output files (compiled).  |

### ✅ How to use  
1. Navigate to the `Day-2` folder.  
2. Open the `.cpp` file you wish to run (e.g., `Square.cpp`).  
3. Compile using:  
   ```bash

 Day 3 
🎯 Objectives

Understand the concept and implementation of the topic for Day 3.

Write a clean, tested solution in your chosen programming language.

Include comments for complexity (time & space) and edge-case handling.

Add at least one simple test case (or set of sample inputs/outputs) so you can verify your code quickly.

🧠 What you’ll learn

Definition of the data structure or algorithm covered on Day 3.

How it operates (basic operations like insertion, deletion, traversal, etc).

Use-cases: when this structure or algorithm is useful.

Implementation details: how to write it from scratch, what pitfalls to watch out for.

Analyzing performance: Time Complexity and Space Complexity.

📁 Files in this folder

main.[ext] — (or whatever filename) your solution file for Day 3.

README.md — this file.

Optionally: a tests/ folder or sample_inputs.txt for practice test cases.
