🚀 Day 1 — The Beginning

Today I start my journey into Data Structures and Algorithms.
No shortcuts, no rush — just consistent effort every single day.

This is the foundation every great programmer builds on.
I’m not competing with anyone else, only with the version of me that didn’t start yesterday.

Let’s write code, make mistakes, learn, and keep moving forward.
One problem at a time. One step closer every day.

## 100 Days DSA – Day-2: Triangle & Pattern Problems

### 📁 Folder: `Day-2`  
This folder contains all the problem-solutions I completed on **Day 2** of my 100-Days DSA challenge.  
The files include various pattern problems and triangles, implemented in C++.

### 🗂️ Contents  
| Filename                   | Description                                   |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `Square.cpp`               | Print a square pattern of stars.              |
| `charSquare.cpp`           | Print a square pattern using characters.      |
| `code.cpp`                 | Miscellaneous code snippet for Day 2.         |
| `numSquare.cpp`            | Print a numeric square pattern.               |
| `star.cpp`                 | Print a star-pattern problem.                  |
| `output/`                  | Executable binaries/output files (compiled).  |

### ✅ How to use  
1. Navigate to the `Day-2` folder.  
2. Open the `.cpp` file you wish to run (e.g., `Square.cpp`).  
3. Compile using:  
   ```bash
   g++ Square.cpp -o Square
   ./Square
